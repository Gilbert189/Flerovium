# Flerovium: Java Edition
A basic Discord implementation of Nihonium.
This is the successor of [Flerovium](https://github.com/Gilbert189/Flerovium), but using [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) instead of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) (rip)

Since this is literally me trying to hack a Java peg into a Python hole, don't expect all commands to work here.

### Required Files/Directories
The bot requires two files and two directory not in the repository to run. These files are:
- `token.txt`, which contains the token for the bots account
- `data.json`, a JSON file containing various statistics. The default is the following: `{"parse_cycles": null, "commands_parsed": 0, "commands_found": 0, "valid_commands": 0}`. (optional)
- `logs`, a directory used to store log files. Default is empty.
- `files`, a directory used to store files generated by the bot. Default contains a single empty file named `_.txt`.
