# Nihonium
A bot for the TBGs

### Required Files
The bot requires two files not in the repository to run. These files are:
- `pass.txt`, which contains the password for the bots account
- `postIDs.json`, a JSON file containing the IDs of the threads the bot can run in, along with the most recently parsed post in each of them. In the format of `{"Thread ID": #_of_posts[, "Thread ID": #_of_posts[,...]]}`
