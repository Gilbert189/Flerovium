# Flerovium: Java Edition
A basic Discord implementation of Nihonium.
This is the successor of [Flerovium](https://github.com/Gilbert189/Flerovium), but using [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) instead of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) ~(rip)~

Since this is literally me trying to hack a Java peg into a Python hole, don't expect all commands to work here.

_Note: This version is "stashed". It might not be updated._

### Required Files/Directories
The bot requires two files and two directory not in the repository to run. These files are:
- `token.txt`, which contains the token for the bots account
- `data.json`, a JSON file containing various statistics. The default is the following: `{"parse_cycles": null, "commands_parsed": 0, "commands_found": 0, "valid_commands": 0}`. (optional)
- `logs`, a directory used to store log files. Default is empty.
- `files`, a directory used to store files generated by the bot. Default contains a single empty file named `_.txt`.

### Flags
These are flags that could be used to alter the behavior of Flerovium. The list of flags are:
```
SETUP_GLOBAL_COMMANDS | Setup global commands.
SETUP_GUILD_COMMANDS  | Setup guild commands for guild ID in $GUILD_ID.
USE_SUBCOMMANDS       | Add subcommands instead of commands. Use this if 
READONLY              | Don't write anything (currently doesn't effect the Python side)
```
To use them, simply add them to the command-line arguments.
